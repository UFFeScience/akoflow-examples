# LoRA Fine Tuning

An AkôFlow orchestration contract fixture. Each declared activity writes deterministic test evidence; this fixture does not implement the model or external service described by its title. The DAG matches the documentation, including parallel branches.

## Run

```sh
./run.sh
```

Requires Go and Python 3 for the standalone smoke test and Docker for execution through AkôFlow. The workflow graph is in [workflow.yaml](./workflow.yaml); the expected contract is in [expected/manifest.json](./expected/manifest.json).

Published image: `ghcr.io/uffescience/akoflow-examples/showcase-lora-fine-tuning:v1`.


## Run locally step by step

### 1. Check the prerequisites

Install Go, Python 3, Docker, and a local AkôFlow server/Desktop. Set the local API connection, then confirm every prerequisite:

```sh
export AKOFLOW_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/akoflow-api
export AKOFLOW_API_TOKEN=akoflow-development-token

python3 --version
docker version
curl --fail -H "Authorization: Bearer $AKOFLOW_API_TOKEN" "$AKOFLOW_API_URL/health/"
```

### 2. Run the deterministic smoke test

From this showcase directory:

```sh
./run.sh
```

The command recreates `outputs/`, launches one process per activity in dependency waves (siblings run concurrently), and validates every artifact declared in `expected/manifest.json`.

### 3. Build the image used by the workflow

```sh
IMAGE=$(sed -n 's/^[[:space:]]*image: //p' workflow.yaml | head -n 1)
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t "$IMAGE" .
```

The workflow command is authoritative. The image intentionally has no competing `ENTRYPOINT`.

### 4. Register the local infrastructure and workflow

```sh
for item in "environments environment.yaml" "execution-scopes scope.yaml" "network-topologies topology.yaml" "workflow-definitions workflow.yaml"
do
  set -- $item
  curl --fail-with-body -H "Authorization: Bearer $AKOFLOW_API_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/yaml' --data-binary "@$2" "$AKOFLOW_API_URL/$1/"
done
```

The order matters: the execution scope references the environment version, the topology references the scope, and the workflow references its namespaced local runtime.

### 5. Plan and execute in AkôFlow Desktop

1. Open **Workflows → Definitions** and select this showcase.
2. Choose **Generate plan**.
3. Select the execution scope imported from `scope.yaml`.
4. Run **HEFT** and select its feasible candidate.
5. Choose **Execute plan** and confirm **Real execution**.
6. Wait until the run is `completed` and every activity is settled.

### 6. Verify the result

Open the completed run and inspect:

- **Activities** for the engine-rendered DAG and per-activity status;
- **Workflow** for the observed execution lifecycle and timing decomposition;
- **Data** for workspace transfers;
- the final activity's **Generated files** table for file names, sizes, and SHA-256 checksums.

Historical captures are stored in `screenshots/`. They predate the corrected DAG and must not be used to verify this revision. New daemon execution and one capture per activity are still required before claiming Desktop verification. Current local evidence is `outputs/dag-validation.json` plus `outputs/stage-<activity>.json`.

Historical capture names:

- `workflow.png`: completed activity DAG;
- `execution.png`: observed execution lifecycle and timing decomposition;
- `outputs.png`: data transfers between activity workspaces;
- `generated-files.png`: files observed in the final output-producing activity.
